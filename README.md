ReportingTrack
==============

This project is to upgrade the existing TestNG report.

Current TestNG report is not intutive as we want it, and it takes soem time to go through the whole report for debugging purpose. Our aim is to work on various technology and come up with a better Reporing front end.

This project will also add some features such as Historical trending and storing test run data for long runs.
